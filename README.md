# DEEPWorkbooks
Each year, the Rice Data Science Club runs the Data Education & Exploration Program (DEEP) to introduce data science fundamentals to the Rice community. For more information
about the program, please use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp6JblzEQMA). DEEP consists of 6 workshops which review each step of the data science pipeline, and
each workshop provides students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with common data science libraries in Python. These workbooks are intended to provide
students with the chance to work with real datasets and apply different techniques in data wrangling, visualization, and modeling.
