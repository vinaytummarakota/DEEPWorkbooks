    "# Metrics for Clustering\n",
    "If you chose 4 clusters for your algorithm, you'll see that K-Means produces a relatively solid clustering. But this raises a more fundamental question: how do you choose the number of clusters for a clustering algorithm in the first place? In our case, it was relatively easy to choose the number of clusterings because the data was 2-D and easy to visualize. However, clustering algorithms aren't always used with such a simple dataset. Therefore, there must be a more systematic way to identify appropriate the number of necessary clusters. One method that calculates the number of necessary clusters is the \"elbow\" method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The elbow method involves testing a set of possible clusterings and then plotting a metric indicating the strength of the clustering for each # of clusters. At some point, the addition of a new cluster will yield little difference in the metric which will be an indication that further clusters are no longer necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Elbow Plot for Inertia Metric\n",
    "The \"inertia\" of a clustering is the sum of the squared distances between every data point and its closest center (the center is typically the average of the data points in the cluster). For this task, test out the k-means algorithm with clusterings between 1 and 11, and plot the inertia at each clustering. What does the elbow plot identify as the optimal number of clusters?\n",
    "\n",
    "*HINT: You don't need to calculate the inertia yourself. Use scikit-learn documentation to find out how to access the inertia directly.*"
